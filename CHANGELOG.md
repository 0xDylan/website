# Changelog for shxrk.dev / shxrk.xyz Version 4

## 4.0.0-beta.1
- Completely rebuild the repo from scractch using `pnpm create astro@latest`
- Add a guns.lol style theme to the website
### What's different from 3.0.0:
- We now use `pnpm` (primarily) instead of `npm` as it works faster and I like it more
- Astro is updated to the latest version
- Website is completely 100% made by me without using any code from other users (thanks very much [Darkn](https://darkn.bio) and [wavee](https://wavee.space))
- Public betas will now be automatically deployed to [shxrk.xyz](https://shxrk.xyz) before they hit Production on [shxrk.dev](https://shxrk.dev)
